 <p> I find it interesting because decisions made by leaders in faraway lands affect me and my country.  Decisions made by the top brass have a profound impact on ordinary people. Keeping myself updated on this issue helps me decide what decision would have been better for the economy and the country.  I did my bachelor's in management as well, so this is another reason I find it interesting.</p>
 <p>The topic is evergreen.</p>
 <p>And it is a trending topic right now with all the trade wire and geopolitical uncertainty.</p>
<p>I think I can actually give a view-worthy, read-worthy opinion, and thus write an article based on that opinion.</p>

<p>Hi, I am Prashan Maharjan. I am a Bachelor's graduate with a degree in management.  I find finance and economics really interesting because I can observe and feel the impacts of them in real life, and the causes and effects of these issues can be quantified.  Not only that, but the numbers do have significance in the life of ordinary people. It is not some vague, abstract scientific stuff that one has a hard time wrapping their brains around. Based on those numbers, a policymaker can then make a sound decision. </p>
<p>In this blog site, I intend to provide information about the global economy in layman's terms, thus making it possible for ordinary people to understand the financial system. </p>
